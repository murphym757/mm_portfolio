                    My name is Maurice Murphy and I'm a forward-thinker. 
                    I use that to my advantage when creating various projects. 
                    My affinity for art drives my design process. My goal is to 
                    consistently improve upon old designs. At the same time, providing 
                    something fresh (and unique) to the overall design. I'm constantly 
                    thinking of ways to test myself and push my skills to the next level. 
                    As I obtain new languages and concepts, this site will continuously be updated.
