                    My name is Maurice Murphy and I'm a forward thinker. 
                    Iâ€™m always looking towards the future and my work reflects 
                    that. My affinity for art drives my design process. I have 
                    a passion for recreating various aesthetics through the use 
                    of Ruby on Rails and Javascript (React). I'm constantly thinking 
                    of ways to test myself and push my skills to the next level. My 
                    goal is to consistently improve my skills while providing the 
                    assistance necessary to help those around me do the same.
